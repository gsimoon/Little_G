                    More than just pizza...
                    <br />
                    Unpretentiously delicious food!
                    <br />
                    Experimenting with unique flavour combinations has always been a passion for our chefs. <br />
                    From when Little g first opened next to its sister café in Highgate Hill, we have loved serving mac n cheese filled arancini balls, Big Mac pizzas, and Bolognese filled spring rolls.
