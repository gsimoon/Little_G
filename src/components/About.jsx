                More than just pizza...
                <br />
                Unpretentiously delicious food!
                <br />
                Experimenting with unique flavour combinations has always been a passion for our chefs. <br />
                From when Little G first opened next to its sister caf√© in Highgate Hill, we have loved serving mac n cheese filled arancini balls, Big Mac pizzas, and Bolognese filled spring rolls.
